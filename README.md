# Logarithmic Transformation and Contrast Enhancement

This repository focuses on image processing and includes the following components:

## Applying Logarithmic Transformation

- **Image Enhancement**: Applies logarithmic transformation to enhance the `cameraman.tif` image, improving its visual quality by adjusting the pixel values.

## Using the Stretching Function

- **Contrast Improvement**: Implements the stretching function to identify inflection points \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). This step enhances the contrast of the transformed image by adjusting the intensity levels.
